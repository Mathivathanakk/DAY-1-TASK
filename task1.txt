DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2

HTTP(HYPERTEXT  TRANSFER PROCOTOL):

=>It is used in client-server communication.
=>By using HTTP,user send the request to the server and the server send the response to the user.

HTTP/1.1:

=>HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997.
=>HTTP/1.1 works on the textual format.
=>MULTIPLEXING:- HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource can't be loaded,
it blocks all other resources behind it.
=>SERVER PUSH:-A server only servers content to a client device if the client asks for it.
=>It uses requests resource inlining for use getting multiple pages.
=>HEADER COMPRESSION:-It compresses data by itself.
=>PRIORITIZATION:-It doesn't have a mechanisms for prioritizing requests.

HTTP/2:

=>The new one is HTTP/2 which was created in 2015.
=>HTTP/2 was developed over the SPDY protocol.
=>HTTP/2 works on the binary farming layer.
=>MULTIPLEXING:-HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP(transfer control protocol) connection to send 
multiple request at once so that no one resource blocks any other resources.
=>SERVER PUSH:-HTTP/2 solves this problem by allowing a server to "push" content to a client 
before the client asks for it.
=>It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
=>HEADER COMPRESSION:-It  uses a more advanced compression method called 'HPACK' that eliminates redundant
information in HTTP header packets. 
=>PRIORITIZATION:- It offers a feature called weighted prioritization, which allows developers to decide
which page resources will load first.
