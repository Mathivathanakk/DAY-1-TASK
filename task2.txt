OBJECTS AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION IN JAVASCRIPT:

OBJECTS:

=>Objects are important data types in JavaScript.
=>A JavaScript object is a collection of named values having state and behavior (properties and method).
=>Objects are Different than primitive datatypes(i.e.number,strings,boolean,undefined,null,bigint).
=>Primitive datatypes contains one value but Objects can hold many values in form of key:value pair.

=>For Example:

Make: Hyundai i20
Model: B-Class
Color: Red
Fuel:petrol
Weight: 1040kg
Mileage: 20Kmpl
Rating: 4.5
  
=>The following code assigns a simple value  to a variable name: 
var car="Hyundai i20"

OBJECT PROPERTIES:

=>The name:values pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties.

=>The following code assigns many values (Hyundai i20,B-class,Red and soo on) to a variable named Car:
var car={Make:"Hyundai i20",Model: "B-Class",Color: "Red",Fuel:"petrol",Weight: "1040kg",
Mileage: "20Kmpl",Rating: 4.5}

=>syntax:-
var <object-name> = {key1: value1, key2: value2,... keyN: valueN};

=>syntax for adding a property to an object:-
ObjectName.ObjectProperty=propertyValues;

=> syntax for deleting a property from an object:-
delete ObjectName.ObjectProperty;

=> syntax to access a property from an object :-
objectName.property        // Car.Make
           (or)
objectName["property”]    // Car["Make"]
           (or)
objectName[expression]   // x = "Make"; Car[x]

=> “Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object”

OBJECT METHODS:-

=>An object method is an object property containing a function definition.

=>syntax:
Example: 
let's assume to start the car there will be a mechanical functionality.
function(){return ignition.on}

=>“Methods are actions that can be performed on objects”
